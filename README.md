# Shape Theory
*A brief discussion on shape theory psychology* from childhood development and historical practices perspectives, by Andrew Kingdom.

*** Need an introduction here to summarise the core thrusts of shape theory and tie general shape theory physchology to all the shapes mentioned herein. We also need an overall coherence and order to this text so as not to ramble aimlessly.

## Circles

Nature has many rounded and curved surfaces, such as tree trunks, river-smoothed stones, bird eggs and so on. The earliest such shape a baby experiences is generally contact with a human face and body if breast-fed.

A mother's face, when viewed up close by a baby, is typically perceived as a rounded shape, often generalized as an oval or circle.<br />

When a child is held close to a parent's face, the face dominates their field of view, while the parent's arms and legs appear further away or out of sight. As children develop their drawing skills, their depictions of people progress through several stages:<br />
&nbsp;<br />

- 12 to 18 months: At this stage, children typically engage in random scribbling as they develop their motor skills and hand-eye coordination.
18 to 24 months: Scribbles become more controlled, and children may start to make repeated marks or basic shapes, though these are not yet representational.
- 2 to 3 years: Children begin to draw simple shapes and may start to create circular scribbles. Scribbling or doodling tends to reflect a , often representing a person's head. These drawings may still lack clear detail or structure.
- Around 4 years old: Children often draw figures resembling a "potato" or "tadpole," where legs and arms are directly attached to a central body shape. This stage reflects their early, close-up visual experiences, where detailed perception of the full human form is limited.

It takes time for the brain to integrate these visual experiences into a complete understanding of the human figure. This developmental process can be more pronounced in children with visual impairments, such as cataracts or malformed pupils, particularly if they later experience improvements in their vision.<br />

## Squares

*Angled shapes* have been useful in human life throughout history. Any *flat surface* we tend to decorate for recordkeeping or artwork purposes. *Right-angles* we use in building *walls*, which are generally formed around stable beams which are upright like trees. Likewise, we use right-angles for stackable bricks made from mud, clay or stone. Because of this, angled shapes such as cubes are strongly associated with manufacture, though curves can also require much work.

<img alt="A child building a wobbly tower with wooden blocks, excitedly showing mother how tall it is." src="shapetheorypix/child-building-wobbly-tower-with-mother-AK.png" style="width:12em;aspect-ratio:auto;border-radius:10px;"><img alt="A different child building a wobbly tower with wooden blocks, excitedly showing mother how tall it is." src="shapetheorypix/right-angles-of-a-square-are-best-for-stable-buildings--andrew-kingdom.jpeg" style="width:12em;aspect-ratio:auto;border-radius:10px;"><br />
 Children learn that the right-angles of a square are generally best for stable building that won't fall down as quickly. Wooden building blocks are typically suitable for children starting from around 12 to 18 months old. At this age, children begin to develop the motor skills and coordination needed to stack and manipulate blocks.

- 12 to 18 months: Children start to explore and stack blocks, usually building simple towers of a few blocks.
- 18 to 24 months: Children improve their hand-eye coordination and may build taller towers and experiment with more complex structures.
- 2 to 3 years: Children’s creativity and understanding of shapes increase, allowing them to construct more elaborate structures and engage in imaginative play with the blocks.

Wooden building blocks continue to be a popular toy well into early childhood, as they promote fine motor skills, spatial reasoning, and creativity. <br />

## Triangles

*** anything here to say from shape theory?

*Sharp shapes* in nature, such as branches of many plants, edges of rocks, and so on. We create *sharp edges* for cutting (from flint, metal, etc) because sharp angles are ideal for such a task. 

<img alt="Photo of a wondering child with happy reassuring parent inside a triangle-faced tent during the rain" src="shapetheorypix/rain-falls-best-off-a-triangle-andrew-kingdom.jpeg" style="width:12em;aspect-ratio:auto;border-radius:10px;"><br />
 Children learn that rain water falls best off an angled roof, like a triangle. 

** Anything more useful to say? Triangles have angles like square but less of them.

## Hexagons

*** anything here to say from shape theory? It's a compact combination of circles and angles.

*Sharp shapes* in nature, such as branches of many plants, edges of rocks, and so on. We create *sharp edges* for cutting (from flint, metal, etc) because sharp angles are ideal for such a task.

## Recordkeeping
*** Needs lead-in and perspective here - we pick up on scribbling mentioned earlier and bring in all shapes for the purpose of discussing shapes as communications of expression, and as a historical memory. This could be subsumed into the Circles section but it's possibly better as a section in its own right?

Scribbling and Symbolic Development: Scribbling in early childhood reflects developmental milestones in motor skills and cognitive processes, including spatial awareness and symbolic representation. Research indicates that the progression from random scribbles to more recognizable shapes aligns with theories in developmental psychology that link motor activity with cognitive development. This stage is crucial for understanding how children conceptualize and externalize their perceptions of the world.<br />

## Historical and Cognitive Evolution in Writing Systems:

- Early Writing Systems: Early writing systems, such as cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, illustrate the evolution from pictographic to ideographic representations. Linear A and B are notable for their role in recording administrative and economic data, showcasing the abstraction of visual symbols into standardized forms.
- Alphabetic Systems: The shift to alphabetic systems, including the Semitic and later Greek alphabets, represents a significant abstraction from logographic and syllabic scripts. Hebrew script’s incorporation of pronunciation cues exemplifies how phonetic elements were integrated into writing systems, influencing the development of Mediterranean alphabets.
- Shape Theory and Language: The relationship between shape theory and language development involves understanding how visual symbols are abstracted and standardized over time. The evolution from pictorial representations to abstract symbols reflects broader cognitive processes, including the development of symbolic thought and the efficiency of written communication.<br />

My interest in this is largely because: psychology and childhood development theory forms an essential part of software design, which is a large part of what I do professionally.
