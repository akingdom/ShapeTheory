A mother’s face up-close is rounded like an oval or circle to a baby.

When a child is held close to a parent's face, the face dominates their field of view, while the parent's arms and legs appear further away or out of sight. As children develop their drawing skills, their depictions of people progress through several stages. Initially, these drawings may consist of simple scribbles, followed by representations that focus solely on the parent's face. By around the age of four, children often begin to draw figures resembling a "potato" or "tadpole," with legs and arms directly attached to a central body shape. This stage reflects their early, close-up visual experiences, where detailed perception of the full human form is limited. It takes time for the brain to integrate these visual experiences into a complete understanding of the human figure. This developmental process can be more pronounced in children with visual impairments, such as cataracts or malformed pupils, particularly if they later experience improvements in their vision.

My interest in this is largely because: psychology and childhood development theory forms an essential part of software design, which is a large part of what I do professionally.
